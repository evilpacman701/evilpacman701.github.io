        <h1 class="title">Things We’d Like To See in Fallout Season 2</h1>
        <p class="intro-p">
          Due to the ending of season 1 it’s pretty clear we’ll be making our
          way to Gorgeous New Vegas in the next season. The Adaptation is set 15
          years after the events in Fallout: New Vegas and due to the story
          decisions in the game there’s no telling what may or may not become
          canon in the show’s story. Here are some of our top picks of things
          we’d like to see pop up or at least get a mention in Fallout season 2:
        </p>
      </div>
      <article class="main-article">
        <img
          src="../Images/FalloutT60.jpg"
          alt="Fallout Still of T60 Armor"
          class="main-image"
        />
        <h3>Benny</h3>
        <p>
          Most likely, we will not see Benny alive. If the Courier has any
          brains left after being shot in the head Benny is rotting somewhere in
          a corner of the Mojave. But maybe a backstory of his place as the head
          of the Chairman of New Vegas would be nice, or just a shot of his
          iconic black and white sport coat could be a fun nod to one of the
          main antagonists of the game.
        </p>

        <h3>Mr. House (Duh)</h3>
        <img
          src="../Images/Article-Images/Mr._House.webp"
          alt=""
          class="article-image"
        />
        <p>
          Anyone who has played New Vegas most likely knows Mr. House very well.
          In fact, he was already technically in the show as the CEO of ROB-CO
          while he and other corporate leaders were spitballing ideas of their
          own vault experiments. We can say with certainty that we will at least
          get a backstory of Mr. House and the Platinum Chip in season 2.
        </p>
        <h3>GoodSprings</h3>
        <p>
          Goodsprings is the first town you wake up in at the beginning of New
          Vegas after being treated by Doc Mitchell. It wouldn’t make a whole
          lot of sense for any of the same characters to still be there but that
          first walk out of the town's too iconic for so many players when
          starting their new journey. Not to mention it’s uncomfortably close to
          Deathclaw territory.
        </p>

        <h3>Craig Boone (or really any other companion)</h3>
        <img
          src="../Images/Article-Images/Craig_Boone.webp"
          alt=""
          class="article-image"
        />
        <p>
          I don’t know about you but Boone was my guy. One of the many
          companions you can get to follow you around the wasteland, Boone is a
          former NCR soldier that the Courier first meets at the T-rex in Novac
          and could be a great way to show the history of the New California
          Republic. He’s a great shot and never takes off his beret. There are
          also great companions like Lily, Raul, or the incredible Rex the
          Cyberdog. All of the companions would be great additions or cameos in
          the next season. We focus on Boone because he’s at a great age in New
          Vegas that would make him about middle aged for when the show gets to
          the Mojave. Boone especially hates Caesar’s Legion, speaking of which…
        </p>
        <h3>Caesar’s Legion</h3>
        <p>
          If you ever want a true chaotic evil run in Fallout: New Vegas look no
          further than Caesar’s Legion. They’re based off of the military of the
          Roman Empire, absolutely brutal and make a lasting impression anytime
          you meet them in the wasteland. Although Caesar himself is likely dead
          at this point the Legion could still live on in some way. Just be sure
          to win their lotteries.
        </p>

        <h3>That One Guy Who Thinks He’s A Ghoul - Chris Haversam</h3>
        <img
          src="../Images/Article-Images/ChrisHaversam.jpg"
          alt=""
          class="article-image"
        />
        <p>
          Probably one of the most memorable side quests in Fallout: New Vegas
          was at the REPCONN test site where you assist a group of ghouls launch
          a rocket to “the Far Beyond”. Among them is a human who speaks and
          acts like a ghoul but is in fact a smooth-faced human. He was left
          behind at the end of the quest or gets revenge on the ghouls who have
          been deceiving him (depending on what the Courier does) and could very
          well still be alive during season 2. Just imagine a scene where Cooper
          Howard meets Chris. It would be absolutely hilarious.
        </p>

        <h3>MORE WASTELAND CREATURES</h3>
        <img
          src="../Images/Article-Images/Albino_Radscorpion.jpg"
          alt=""
          class="article-image"
        />
        <p>
          The first season we only got a good look at a handful of the
          wasteland’s wildlife and it's already been confirmed that Deathclaws
          will make their official debut in season 2. Still, we’d like to see
          more of the smaller enemies like geckos, radscorpions, giant ants,
          bighorners and maybe a super mutant fighting a T60… if it’s not too
          much to ask…
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter if they end up incorporating any old characters from the
          games we couldn’t be more hyped for season 2. It hasn’t been
          officially announced when season 2 will arrive but it will most likely
          be near the end of 2025.
