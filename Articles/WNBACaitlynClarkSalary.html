          WNBA Athlete Caitlin Clark’s Salary Leaked, Spark Fans Upset and
          Aiming to Boycott
        </h1>
        <p class="intro-p">
          On April 15th the details of WNBA player Caitlin Clark contract was
          leaked on X sparking a huge upset over the salaries the WNBA players
          are paid compared to their NBA counterparts. The contract starts at
          $76,535 in 2024 and grows to $97,582 in 2027. This salary is
          absolutely dwarfed by any NBA rookie entering the league with averages
          at a whopping $10.1 million reported by Fox Sports.

        />
        <p>
          Since the leak many twitter users have been outraged by the vast
          difference in pay pitted against those that are defending the WNBA.
          Many say the salaries are for good reason because the WNBA is simply
          not at the same level as the NBA. The NBA reported a total revenue
          from the 2022/23 season amounting to 10.58 billion dollars - while the
          WNBA has had an average of a $10 million net loss (revenue costs) per
          year since it was founded in 1996.
        </p>
        <p>
          This feels like a great time to watch the famous Bill Burr bit which
          calls out that even the people clamoring for equality in the space
          aren’t even watching WNBA games and can’t name more than one player.
          The reason for the huge difference is simple - WNBA does not have
          viewership or ticket sales to afford larger salaries for their
          players.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the outrage there has been good news for Caitlyn Clark, she
          recently landed a huge signature shoe deal with Nike, reportedly
          amounting over $20 million.

          Hopefully, this news will open up brand deals for more WNBA players to
          add to their income. And at least now if someone asks you to name a
          WNBA player we can all say “Caitlin Clark”.
